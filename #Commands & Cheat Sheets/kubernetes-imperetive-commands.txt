1.To create docker image of our kubernetes application
  docker build -t kubernetes-starter-app .

2.To start kubernates cluster
  minikube status
  minikube start --driver=docker

  kubectl help
  kubectl create

3. To create deployment. try following but failed. The deployment is created but the pod will fail
  kubectl create deployment first-app --image=kubernetes-starter-app
  kubectl get deployment
  kubectl get pods

4. To delete deployment. 
  kubectl delete deployment first-app

5. To solve problem, push image to docker hub
  docker tag kubernetes-starter-app bhoirmakarand/kubernetes-starter-app
  docker push bhoirmakarand/kubernetes-starter-app

6. To create deployment object once again with image from docker hub
  kubectl create deployment first-app --image=bhoirmakarand/kubernetes-starter-app
  kubectl get deployment
  kubectl get pods

7. To check as of running pods and deployment
  minikube dashboard

8. To exposes pods to the cluster or externally we used service object. Pods has internal IP address that gets change very often. Services group pods with shared IP address. Services can allow external access to pods.
Without services, pods are very hard to reach and communication is difficult. Reaching a pod from outside the cluster is not possible at all without service

  kubectl expose deployment first-app --type=LoadBalancer --port 8080
  kubectl get services

  minikube service first-app

  http://localhost:port/
  http://localhost:port/error --> as per app, will crash but kubernetes will restart the pods
  kubectl get pods

9. To scale-up
  kubectl scale deployment/first-app --replicas=3
  kubectl get pods
